# Collision Avoidance Challenge - My personal Notebook Repository

This repository contains material around the "Collision Avoidance Challenge" hosted by the European Space Agency (ESA). The challenge focuses on predicting collision risks between spacecraft and debris using machine learning techniques. This project aims to reproduce the approaches of the top-performing teams as described in the article "Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge: Design and Results of a Machine Learning Competition" and explore alternative solutions.

## Contents
